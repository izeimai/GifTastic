*What does the project do?* 
Allows the user to search for gifs by accessing the GIPHY API. Users are given the option to click on any of the pre-made topic buttons or generate a new topic button using the search form and clicking submit. The page will populate with 10 gifs that are related to that topic search term. 

*Why is the project useful?*
Taught me how to use AJAX calls to retrieve information from APIs. On-click switches between the still and active gif images are also interesting.

*Follow up work*
At the current moment, any topic could be entered into the form area to generate gifs of unrelated topics. I will look up a way to limit the search topics so there are restrictions to just food themed gifs. Whether this involves linking to another API that has all the food related search terms, or whether this is something I can limit locally, or if it's a functionality available through GIPHY requires more research.
